	\entry*[Choir] 4 years of practice, mostly gospel, with many concerts
  performed in churches and concert halls;
	\entry*[Argentinian tango] 2 years of practice. Great interest for this
  sophisticated music and subtle dancing technique;
	\entry*[French fighting cane] 3 years of practice; I really
  like the choregraphic style of this sport, and also its non-violent
  philosophy.

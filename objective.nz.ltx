  \entry*[] I am an Engineer in Information Technologies. I have a great deal of
  experience in Development Quality Process. I firmly believe that good
  communication is the key to the best working environment.

  \par I had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers, and I'm eager to
  work in this type of environment again. University seems to be the perfect
  place to use my skills at their full potential, to help researchers find the
  best answers to complex problems.
